# PERN Stack Blog
A blog site that users can login to and create thier own blog posts. This project is intended to help me practice creating a react app using an express server and connecting to a PostgreSQL database. I plan on creating everything from scratch, though I will be relying heavily on my previously completed tutorial by [Shaun Wassell on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site) which I created a repostiory on GitHub found [here](https://github.com/JustinHoch/my-blog-react). In Shaun Wassell's tutorial he used Mongodb to persist his data. In this project I plan on using PostgreSQL and implementing user accounts with login/logout functionality. To keep the scope of this project from getting too big, I do not plan on letting users upload images. It will be a text only blog with limited customization.
## Learning Objectives
- React components, state, and routing
- Styling a react app using CSS (up until this point I have been relying on tutorial authors pre-made CSS for styling)
- Building backend functionality using Express and connecting to a PostgreSQL database to preform CRUD operations
- Implementing login/logout functionality with password hashing **(I am anticipating this to be especially difficult)**
- Connecting frontend and backend to complete the application
## Project Plan
1. Create frontend
2. Create backend
3. Connect backend to PostgreSQL database and create API's and test using Postman
4. Connect frontend and backend
